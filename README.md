# Real-Time Cooperative Decentralised Control of Illuminance Systems

The project consists on a real-time cooperative decentralised control of an illuminance system with several luminaires, representing an open working space. Each luminaire is composed by one LED (light-emitting diode), one LDR (light dependent resistor), one Arduino and one CAN-BUS. The luminaires in the network are connected by a CAN-BUS system which is used to make a collective communication. We implemented an intelligent lighting system for the distribution illuminance control, considering not only the value of oneâ€™s luminaire but also its neighbourhoods. The formulated problem is based in the Consensus algorithm, that takes into account the power consumption of each luminaire and the minimum luminance when the desk is occupied or unoccupied. The algorithm evaluates the influence of all luminaires on each other and renders the best reference value for each node in the network in order to save as much energy as possible, fulfilling the constrains. In addition, we implemented an asynchronous TCP and UDP server that can be hosted by a Raspberry Pi, that communicates with an Arduino through Serial. Bearing in mind that the server can hold many asynchronous TCP and UDP clients, we defined two rules: 1) UDP connection is used to transfer large amounts of data (e.g. information of the last minute and live streaming), and a TCP connection for more precise commands (e.g. set or get occupancy at one desk); 2) multi-threading server to take the most advantage of the quad-core CPU that the hardware of the server has;.
